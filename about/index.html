title: About Me
---
<p>I'm currently in my 3B year of Software Engineering at University of Waterloo. I've had 4 coop work terms within the last 2 years. 2 terms (8 months) at Aria Solutions Inc. in Calgary, AB, Canada. A work term at Research in Motion, and my last work term at LinkedIn in always-sunny Mountain View, California.</p>
<p>During my spare time, I enjoy playing video games such as Starcraft II and the NHL series. When I was in elementary school, my passion for games led me to learn to program in VBScript and AutoIt to develop extensions for my favourite games.</p>
<p>Besides gaming, my hobbies also include playing sports, especially hockey and snowboarding during the winter and golf and tennis during the summer.</p>
<p>For detailed information regarding my projects and technical skills, please see my resume and my github.</p>
<p>I'll update this page today (Sept 27, 2012) but first I need to get some sleep.</p>
